        A custom U-Net-like model for image forecasting, built upon `ForecasterBase`.

        This class wraps the `ForecasterBase` model from `torchcnnbuilder` to provide
        a convenient interface for constructing a U-Net-like architecture tailored
        for forecasting tasks. It handles the initial setup of the image size
        and delegates the core model logic to `ForecasterBase`.

        Args:
            num_layers (int): The number of layers (depth) for the U-Net-like architecture.
                            This parameter is passed directly to `ForecasterBase`.
            channels_in (int): The number of input channels (channels are the smallest uni). This corresponds
                            to `in_time_points` in `ForecasterBase`.
            channels_out (int): The number of output channels (time duration that model will predict). 
                            This corresponds to `out_time_points` in `ForecasterBase`.
            image_size (Union[List[int], int]): The spatial dimensions of the input image.
                                                 If an integer is provided, it will be
                                                 interpreted as a square image (e.g., 256
                                                 becomes [256, 256]). This is used as
                                                 `input_size` for `ForecasterBase`.

            x (torch.Tensor): The input tensor to the model. Expected shape depends on
                              the `ForecasterBase` requirements, typically
                              `(batch_size, channels_in, height, width)`.
